# Adding Linux SQL to AD domain

# STEP 1
#RHEL
sudo yum install realmd krb5-workstation

#Step2 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
<...>
PEERDNS=no
DNS1=**<AD domain controller IP address>**

#Step3

sudo systemctl restart network

#Step4
nameserver **<AD domain controller IP address>**

#Step5
Once you've confirmed that your DNS is configured properly, 
join the domain by running the following command. 
You must authenticate using an AD account that has sufficient privileges in AD to join a new machine to the domain.
Specifically, this command creates a new computer account in AD, 
create the /etc/krb5.keytab host keytab file, and configure the domain in /etc/sssd/sssd.conf:

#Step6
sudo realm join contoso.com -U 'user@CONTOSO.COM' -v
<...>
* Successfully enrolled machine in realm

#Step7
id user@contoso.com
uid=1348601103(user@contoso.com) gid=1348600513(domain group@contoso.com) groups=1348600513(domain group@contoso.com)

#Step8
kinit user@CONTOSO.COM
Password for user@CONTOSO.COM:

#Step9
klist
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1000
Default principal: user@CONTOSO.COM
